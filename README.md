# Welcome to the ElementZero Website!

ElementZero is Minecraft server software that runs on top of the official server software to provide mod support and extra features.

To get started, you should take a look at our [Wiki](https://github.com/Element-0/ElementZero/wiki). You can also look at our [Forums](https://elementzero.flarum.cloud/) for some helpful guides.

If you're looking for mods, those can also be found on the [Forums](https://elementzero.flarum.cloud/).

**PLEASE NOTE:** This site is a WIP. More will be added to it in time.
